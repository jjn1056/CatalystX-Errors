          - Tweaked the exception class so it plays nicer with subclassers

0.001007 2021-11-05
          - Default HTML template provides a blank favicon to prevent some browers from creating
            an extra request to look for it.  Just something that annoys me :)
          - Documentation and example of subclassing the exception classes to play nice with th
            RenderError plugin.

0.001008 2022-07-05
          - Refactored to move most of the content negotiation into the plugin, so we can simplify
          the views.
          - JSON view changed to return its data more like the Text and HTML views
          - HTTP Exception object refactored to use a role (which is now preferred for custom exceptions)
          - You can now add additional headers in the exception object, and pass headers via the dispatch
          and detach errors methods.
          - using status_code instead of jsut status.  This is a break change but needed because I found
          'status' was just too generic and was causing namespace conflicts.
          - improved the docs a bit.

0.001009 2022-07-24
          - fixed minor issue were we'd get double logging to the Catalyst error log, but miss logging
            other things that needed logging.
